# Here is a program where I  webscraped from the site "web archive" to get a list of the top 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. In my program I used a python module by the name of Beautiful Soup, which specifically deals with html/xml parsing. Once you run the file, it will create a txt file that'll give you a list of all the movies in order. Have you seen most of these movies?
